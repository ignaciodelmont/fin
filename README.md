# FIN

A small project to track my income and expenses.


## Motivation
I wan to have a clear view of my money management.


## Technical motivation
- I want to explore (HATEOAS)[https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/] (probably in a not-so-pure way)
by leverageing a a REST (hopefully close to RESTful) API.

- I'll probably also expose a GraphQL api.


### TODOs
- Better reorg of the project
- More tests
- Features:
  - Add/Remove Labels
  - Add/Remove Labels on Transactions
  - Use an openapi to suggest Labels on Transactions
  - Create login page and move away from the hardcoded top-level header
